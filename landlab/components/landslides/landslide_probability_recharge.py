    """Landlab component designed to calculate probability of failure at
    each grid node based on the infinite slope stability model
    stability index (Factor of Safety).

    Relative wetness and factor-of-safety are based on the infinite slope
    stability model driven by topographic, soil and **recharge** data provided
    by user as inputs to the component. For each node, component simulates mean
    relative wetness as well as the probability of saturation based on Monte Carlo
    simulation of relative wetness where the probability is the number of
    iterations with relative wetness >= 1.0 divided by the number of iterations.
    Probability of failure for each node is also simulated in the Monte Carlo
    simulation as the number of iterations with factor-of-safety <= 1.0
    divided by the number of iterations.

    The main method of the LandslideProbability class is
    `calculate_landslide_probability()``, which calculates the mean soil
    relative wetness, probability of soil saturation, and probability of
    failure at each node based on a Monte Carlo simulation.

            Set as None to use saturated__thickness_distribution.

            Note: this input method is a very specific one, and to use this method,
            one has to refer Ref 1 & Ref 2 mentioned above, as this set of

            acceleration due to gravity.
        seed: int, optional
            seed for random number generation. if seed is assigned any value
            other than the default value of zero, it will create different
            sequence. To create a certain sequence repititively, use the same
            value as input for seed.
